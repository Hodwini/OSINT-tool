# OSINT-tool
A high-performance, fast OSINT tool, for collecting public information on the Web.

##  Features:

This tool is written in Python, which means that the readability of the code and the ability to modify it is not a problem.
This is my first serious pet project for my portfolio.

**Let's take a look at its capabilities:**

- Parsing `.cv`, `.db`, `.json`, `.html`, `.txt`, & etc
- Social network profile analysis
- Whois
- Viewing the web archive of the site/account
- Much more
